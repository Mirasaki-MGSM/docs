## Discord Webhooks

As of now, MGSM supports Discord webhooks. These webhooks are used to notify you about certain events that occur in your MGSM instance. 

## Custom Webhooks

In the future, we plan to add support for more webhook providers, including custom webhooks. This update is largely dependent on the [public API update](https://github.com/Mirasaki-MGSM/issue-tracker/issues/71), which aims to provide a robust and flexible interface for interacting with MGSM programmatically. Stay tuned for updates!
