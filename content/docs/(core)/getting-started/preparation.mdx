| Game-server or community | The name of your game-server or community. This can be anything you like, but it should be (somewhat) unique to you and easy to remember.                                                              | `My Awesome Game Server`                                  |

## Extras (optional)

If you would like to save additional time during the onboarding process, you can also prepare the following:

<Callout type="warn">
  Skip this section if you're not very technical, or if something here isn't
  immediately clear to you. We will review this information with you during the
  onboarding process, and assist you with the setup.
</Callout>

### 1. Discord Application

MGSM uses Discord for authentication and communication. If you would like to use MGSM, you will need to create a Discord application. We have documented the process in [this guide](/docs/integrations/discord).

### 2. Steam API Key

If you would like to use Steam authentication, you will need to create a Steam API key. You can find more information about this in the [documentation](/docs/integrations/steam).

### 3. CFTools Access Grant

If you would like to use CFTools integration (server status, priority queue, etc.), you will need to provide us with an [access grant](https://app.cftools.cloud/authorize/6709668146b3a1fc4c9de212). You can read more about this process [here](/docs/integrations/cftools).

### 4. Domain, DNS, and SSL/TLS configuration (advanced)

MGSM uses [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) for DNS and SSL/TLS. If you would like to use your own domain name, you will need to set up a Cloudflare account and configure your DNS settings. We created [detailed instructions](/docs/advanced/cloudflare) to help you with this process - **please note** that we will guide you through this process during the onboarding process, you are not required to do this yourself.
