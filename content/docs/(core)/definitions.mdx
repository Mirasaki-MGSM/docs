## Structure

The MGSM platform is made up of several components, each of which plays a different role in providing you with the service. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

## People

A clear distinction we need to make is that there are two main groups of people that interact with the MGSM platform:

<Cards className="gap-2">
  <Card
    className="shadow-none"
    title="Clients"
    icon={<BriefcaseIcon />}
    description="Client are users of the MGSM platform/service, if you manage an instance of the platform, you are a client of MGSM."
  />
  <Card
    className="shadow-none"
    title="Users"
    icon={<UsersIcon />}
    description="Users are individuals who interact with your instance. Generally speaking, these are your players, customers, or the people that form your community."
  />
</Cards>
