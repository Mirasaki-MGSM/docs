## Introduction

The [LB Core](https://lbmaster.de/product.php?id=17) API is a powerful tool that allows you to programmatically make LB Master related changes. If you use any LB Master mods on your server, you can use this tool to automatically assign in-game perks (relating to [LB Master mods](https://lbmaster.de/)) to players who purchase them on your website.

## Perks

The following perks are available to be automated through a connection between our servers and the LB Core API:

- [Player **Chat Prefixes**](/docs/integrations/lb-master/chat-prefixes)
- [Group **Tag Colors**](/docs/integrations/lb-master/chat-tag-colors)
- [Group and Player **Skins**](/docs/integrations/lb-master/skins)
- [Cosmetic **Spawn Clothing**](/docs/integrations/lb-master/spawn-clothing) (coming soon)
- [Custom **Killfeed Colors**](/docs/integrations/lb-master/killfeed-colors)

## Getting Started

To get started with the LB Core API, you will need to install the LB Core mod on your server. You can find the mod on [their website](https://lbmaster.de/product.php?id=17), along with [installation instructions](https://lbmaster.de/install/?p=17&h=1). Do note, you can change your server host/provider at the top of the page to personalize the installation instructions.

### Configuration

The configuration file can be found at the following location: `profiles\LBmaster\Config\Common\Api.json`.

#### Example

```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "entries": [ 
        {

            "apiKey": "{{API_KEY}}",
            "restrictedAccess": 1
        }
    ]
}
```
