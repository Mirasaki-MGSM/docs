## Configuration

Multiple different configurations are available for (group) chat prefixes:

- **Direct**: If `useRedeemPoints` is disabled on the CMS, a `inputName` is required (`Product (Variant)` > `Form Input#name`) which is used to collect the color, and is directly applied to the group through our connection to the LB Core API.
- **Indirect**: If `useRedeemPoints` is enabled on the CMS, the user that purchases the product will be able to select a color in-game (`Map` > `Group`), consuming the point they purchased.
