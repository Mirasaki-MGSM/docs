## Steps

    <Step>
        ### Create the Application

        <Card
            href="https://discord.com/developers/applications?new_application=true"
            className="shadow-none"
            title="Create Application"
            icon={<PlusIcon className="text-green-500" />}
        >
            Click here to create a new Discord application.
        </Card>

        <Callout type="info">
            While a **new** application isn't technically required, it is recommended to create a new application for MGSM to use. Things might not work correctly if you use a token from an existing application, depending on the application's configuration.
        </Callout>

        Provide a name for your application and click the "Create" button.
    </Step>

    <Step>
        ### Configure the Application

        We will need the following information from the application:

        | Name | Description |
        | ---- | ----------- |
        | Application ID | This is the unique identifier for your application. |
        | Token | This is the token that will be used to authenticate your bot. |
        | Secret | This is the secret that will be used to authenticate your bot. |

        <DocsNotPersonalized className="my-0" />

        1. Copy the "Application ID" from the "General Information" tab.
        2. Click on the "Bot" tab in the sidebar.
            - Click the "Reset Token" button to generate a new token.
            - Scroll a little bit down until you find "Privileged Gateway Intents", enable the "Server Members Intent".
            - If you want to make this application private, you will have to select `None` for "Install Link" under the "Installation" tab.
        3. Click on the "OAuth2" tab in the sidebar.
            - Click the "Reset Secret" button to generate a new secret.
            - Click the "Add Redirect" button and add the following URL:
                <DiscordRedirectUrl className='mt-2' />
            - Provide your "Your Application ID" from earlier, and open the generated link in a new tab.
                <DiscordBotInvite className='mt-2' />
    </Step>
</Steps>
