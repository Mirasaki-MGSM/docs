## Introduction

The CMS (Content Management System) in MGSM is a powerful interface that allows you to create and manage Content Types.

### What is a Content Type?

A Content Type is a structured collection of fields that represent a specific type of content. For example, a "Product" Content Type might have fields for the product name, price, description, and image. Content Types are used to define the structure of your content and provide a consistent way to manage and display it.

### What is a Field?

A Field is a single piece of data within a Content Type. Fields can be of different types, such as text, number, date, boolean, or relation. Each field has a name, type, and other settings that define how it behaves and is displayed in the CMS.

### What is a Relation?

A Relation is a special type of field that links one Content Type to another. For example, a "Product" Content Type might have a relation field that links it to a "Variant" Content Type. Relations are used to establish connections between different types of content and create complex data structures.
