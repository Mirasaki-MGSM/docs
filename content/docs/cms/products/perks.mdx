### Is Server Select <FieldBadges type='boolean' defaultValue={false} /> [#isServerSelect]

### Perk Expire Hours <FieldBadges type='number' min={-1} /> [#perkExpireHours]

The number of hours the user will have access to the perks when purchasing the product. Perks are special benefits, rewards, or features that users receive when they purchase the product.
