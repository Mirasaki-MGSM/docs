## Pre-requisites

### Requirements

Before you can get started with MGSM, you will need to have the following:

1. [x] Game-server or community
2. [x] Valid email address
3. [x] Excitement to get started!

Before you start the onboarding process, please make sure you followed the [preparation steps](/docs/getting-started/preparation) to ensure that you have all the necessary information ready. While not technically required, it will make the onboarding process much smoother and quicker.

## Onboarding process

        ### [Beta] Create a sales ticket

        The first step in the onboarding process is to create a sales ticket. You can do this by visiting the [MGSM Discord server](https://discord.gg/mgsm) and navigating to the `#ðŸŽ«â–¸ticket-support` channel. You will need to provide some basic information, such as your name, email address, etc.
